## Infinity 27 Skills Bootcamp

During this 2 week skills bootcamp I worked on developing a spell for Infinity 27's game called Samsara. This was done using blueprints in Unreal Engine.
Below is a video of the presentation of the work I did during the skills bootcamp as well as me answering questions about the work.
