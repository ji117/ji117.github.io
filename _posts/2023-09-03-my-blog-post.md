## MSc Final Project

For the final project of my Games Engineering MSc I decided to create a digital museum in VR featuring the historical computing collection present at Newcastle University in the Urban Science Building. This virtual museum was created inside a 3D model of the Urban Science Building that was provided to me and the project was created using Unity.  
Below is a video showing what I did for this project and a link to the git repo to view the code.
