## 2D Space Shooter Game

Here is a game that I made using a simple game engine that was provided to me which could only draw and play sounds.
I had to add additional functionality to the game engine in order to produce the game shown below. The game was programmed using C++.

This screenshot shows the game's game over screen. 


The goal of the game is to kill all the enemies present in a level. When all enemies in a level are killed after a short delay the next level is started. 

Listed below are the additions I made to the game engine for the game.  
Added a gameobject super class  
Added classes for each individual game object  
Added an animation system  
Added a system to play sounds  
Added an object manager to handle and keep track of all the game objects  
Added a way for game objects to detect collisions  
Added a level manager to control the levels in the game
