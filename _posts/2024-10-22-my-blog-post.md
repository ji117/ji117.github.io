## Springboard 2024

Springboard is an 8-week program that I participated in. I was tasked with making a prototype of a game with a small team. 
The game we created is called Instrumentalia and it is a visual novel/ guitar hero-inspired rhythm game that can be played on itch.io <a href="https://ji117.itch.io/instrumentalia">here</a>. Also, you can view the code on the git repo <a href="https://github.com/ji117/Instrumentalia">here</a>. 
I was the project's lead programmer, implementing all major features. The other programmer credited with this project was mainly responsible for some additions to the UI and other minor changes/ adjustments.
The creation of this game was split into two parts. The visual novel side of the game and the rhythm game. The main challenge was the rhythm game as this was the first time I worked on a game of this nature. To help me with this I used FMOD, which was the first time I used the plugin as well, for its beat tracking capabilities and had plans to use its adaptive audio to change the song of the rhythm game based on player performance and player choices but this was outside the scope of the prototype.

Below is the game's trailer (note the trailer was not created by me)
